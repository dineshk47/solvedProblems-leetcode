Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).

 

Example 1:

Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].



class Solution:
    def countOdds(self, low: int, high: int) -> int:
        # # this will check if both high and low were even numbmers if yes then return high-low/2
        # if low % 2 == 0 and high % 2 == 0:
        #     return int((high-low)/2)
        # # for the rest of the cases it will be (high-low/2)+1
        # else:
        #     return int((high-low)/2+1)
        
        
        if low%2 == 0 and high%2 == 0:
            return int((high-low)/2)
        else:
            return int((high-low)/2+1)
