Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.


class Solution(object):
    def middleNode(self, head):
        # While slow moves one step forward, fast moves two steps forward.
        # Finally, when fast reaches the end, slow happens to be in the middle of the linked list.
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        return slow
