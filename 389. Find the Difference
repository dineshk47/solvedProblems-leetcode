You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.


class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        return chr(sum(map(ord, t)) - sum(map(ord, s)))
        
#         ex=0
#         for ch in s+t:
#             ex^=ord(ch)
        
#         return chr(ex)
